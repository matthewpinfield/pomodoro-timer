## Pomodoro Technique Basics

The FocusPie app follows the Pomodoro technique:

1. Work for a set period (default 25 minutes)

3. After completing several work cycles, take a longer break (default 15 minutes)
4. Repeat the process

This technique helps maintain focus while preventing burnout through regular breaks.
