# **Styling: Tailwind CSS & Classname Utils**

*   **Styling Method:** Strictly use **Tailwind CSS v3.x (latest stable)** utility classes. *(Note: Tailwind CSS v4 is in alpha/beta as of late 2024)*. Avoid custom CSS files unless necessary and matching existing patterns.
*   **Tooling:** Utilizes the modern Tailwind engine (PostCSS/Autoprefixer often handled implicitly).
*   **Classname Management:** Use the `cn(...)` utility function for conditional (`clsx`) and merged (`tailwind-merge`) classes. Example: `className={cn("base-class", { "conditional-class": condition })}`
*   **Theming:** Use Tailwind's `dark:` variant for dark mode styles (`next-themes` is configured).
