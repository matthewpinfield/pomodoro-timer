# Your rule content

- [transferToResponsive.md](mdc:transferToResponsive.md)
- Okay, I need you to refactor this React component code. REMEMBER THE NEW RULE: We must use Tailwind CSS utilities and relative units (`rem`, `%`) for all sizing, spacing, layout, and fonts. We MUST AVOID fixed pixel (`px`) values. Pay close attention to parent element sizing, especially if it contains other elements like a canvas.

Here is the old code with fixed pixel problems:
```jsx
// [Paste your problematic React component code here]
    className="w-full h-full max-w-[400px] md:max-w-full mx-auto"
    className="w-full h-full max-w-[600px] md:max-w-full mx-auto"
