description: Utility library guidelines - Use date-fns for date/time, uuid (v4/v7) for unique IDs (see state management rule for details), and framer-motion for subtle animations.

# **Utility Libraries**

*   **Date/Time:** Use `date-fns` for all date/time formatting and manipulation.
*   **Unique IDs:** Use `uuid` (specifically `v4()` or `v7()`) for generating unique identifiers, especially within `TaskContext`. **See State Management section for v4 vs v7 considerations.**
*   **Animation:** Use `framer-motion` for subtle UI animations or transitions where appropriate for MVP.
