# **UI Components: Shadcn UI (Limited Set)**

*   **Library:** Shadcn UI, built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.
*   **Available Core Components:** ONLY use the following components from `/components/ui`: `Button`, `Dialog`, `Input`, `Label`, `Alert`, `Textarea`, `Toggle`.
*   **Constraint:** Many Shadcn UI components were *removed*. Do NOT use or suggest components other than those listed above. If a new one is needed, the command is `pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]`.
*   **Priority:** Reuse these existing components whenever applicable.
